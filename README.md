This Revit plugin is part of a comprehensive research framework for **BIM-based Schedule Generation and Optimization Using Genetic Algorithms**. It serves as the BIM Modeler Assistant component, automating the creation and placement of structural elements in Autodesk Revit from Excel data.

> üî¨ **Research Context:** This plugin is a component of the research paper: [BIM-based schedule generation and optimization using genetic algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580524002127?via%3Dihub) published in *Automation in Construction* journal.

> üì¶ **Complete Framework:** For the full research implementation including schedule optimization, genetic algorithms, and 5D simulation, visit the main repository: [P6-Automation](https://github.com/Mohamed-Elnahla/P6-Automation)

## Plugin Features

### üèóÔ∏è **Family Creation from Excel**

The plugin automatically creates Revit families from Excel files for:

1. **Levels** - Generate building levels with elevations
2. **Structural Elements:**
   - Columns
   - Beams
   - Walls
   - Slabs
   - Isolated Footings (RC & PC)
   - Slab Footings
   - Piles
   - Title Blocks

*Excel templates for family creation are included in the plugin resources.*

### üìç **Element Placement from Excel**

Automatically places structural elements at specified coordinates based on Excel files:

1. **Columns** - Place at grid intersections
2. **Beams** - Position along structural grids
3. **Walls** - Create along specified paths
4. **Isolated Footings** - Place at column bases
5. **Slabs** - Generate floor systems
6. **Piles** - Position pile foundations

*Excel templates for element placement are included in the plugin resources.*

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Copy the `.addin` and `.dll` files to your Revit Add-ins folder:
   - `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\[REVIT_VERSION]\`
3. Restart Autodesk Revit
4. The plugin will appear in the Revit ribbon

---

## Usage

1. **Family Creation:** Use the Excel templates in `Resources/Excel/Families/` to define your structural elements
2. **Element Placement:** Use the Excel templates in `Resources/Excel/Location/` to specify coordinates
3. **Level Creation:** Use `Resources/Excel/Levels.xlsx` to define building levels
4. Access the plugin tools through the Revit ribbon interface
